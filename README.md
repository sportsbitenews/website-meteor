# PhET Website Migration Project

The purpose of this repo is to contain the Meteor-React upgrade of the PhET Website.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repo: https://github.com/phetsims/website-meteor.git
2. Install Meteor 1.5, as of this writing it is available at https://www.meteor.com/install.  Windows is not recommended as build times are unreasonably slow.
3. In the website-meteor directory, run `meteor npm install`.
4. Run `meteor`.  This will start the server and publish the app on port 3000.
